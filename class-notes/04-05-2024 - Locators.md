	RECAP:

	Bundled Libraries

	Mocha and Chai

		Mocha: describe() and it()

			describe() => It's a method it groups the tests together.

			it() 		=> Defines individual test block.


		Chai: All the assertions we will use comes from the chai.

	Basic Commands:	

		- cy.visit() - It's a method that takes us to specific URL.
		- cy.go()	 - It's a navigation that helps you to go back and forward
		- cy.reload() - Refreshes the page.

		- should() - It's a main assertion method.

		- cy.get() - It's a method that helps us to query the element we find on the DOM.

	Locators:

		- XPath and CSS

			- Xpath: 
			Slower compared to CSS
			Syntax is a little harder

			- CSS:
			Faster compared to XPATH
			It's easir to learn and use
